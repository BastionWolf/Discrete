Program 2 Sets

Set A = { 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13,}

Set B = { 2, 3, 4, 13, 18,}

The intersection of Sets A and B = { 3, 4, 13,}

The union of Sets A and B = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13, 18,}

A - B = { 1, 6, 9, 12,}

B - A = { 2, 18,}

A complement = { 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,}

B complement = { 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20,}
